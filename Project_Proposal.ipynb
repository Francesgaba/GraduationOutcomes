    "## introduction\n",
    "The New York City Department of Education is the largest system of public schools in the United States, serving over a million students in more than 1,800 schools. The performance and demographic makeup of these schools are critical for policymakers, educators, and the community at large, as they reflect not only the effectiveness of educational strategies but also social and economic trends within the city's diverse population. Education outcomes such as graduation rates have profound implications for students' future employment opportunities, income levels, and socio-economic mobility. By examining detailed school-level demographics and accountability snapshots alongside graduation outcomes, researchers can identify patterns and disparities in educational achievement."

    "## Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the combined effect of school characteristics and student social backgrounds on graduation outcomes in New York City public schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "* How effectively can machine learning techniques, such as linear regression, predict graduation outcomes based on a school's demographic and accountability dataï¼Ÿ\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question explores how factors like special education program availability influence graduation rates. Insights from this study could help schools allocate resources more effectively, especially for students from less affluent backgrounds. Sub-questions will focus on the impact of income levels, ethnic backgrounds, gender differences, and the effectiveness of ELL and SPED programs.\n",
    "The second question aim to assess if machine learning models, such as linear regression, can accurately predict graduation rates. The goal is to identify the most effective model, which could then assist schools in better supporting at-risk students and optimizing graduation outcomes."

    "To conduct our study, we will utilize two datasets from the New York City Department of Education available publicly on the NYC Open Data platform. The first dataset is titled \"2006-2012 School Demographics and Accountability Snapshot.\" and the second is \"2005-2010 Graduation Outcomes - School Level.\" These datasets encompass a wealth of information ranging from enrollment numbers and demographics to graduation outcomes for NYC public schools.\n",

    "To explore how school characteristics and student graduation outcomes are related in New York City public schools, we plan to collect and merge data from two main sources: API data and a secondary dataset in CSV format hosted on GitHub. This merged dataset will allow us to investigate the statistical relationships between school demographics, the effectiveness of special education and ELL programs, and their influence on graduation rates. Through exploratory data analysis, we aim to visualize distributions and correlations, addressing data cleanliness and feature relevance in the process. Ultimately, our goal is to build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning techniques such as linear regression, to  identify key factors that most significantly affect graduation outcomes.\n",
